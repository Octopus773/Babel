Hi dear reader.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceBabel}{Babel}} is a project aiming to create a Vo\+IP application. Vo\+IP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol.

You may already know some applications that use this technique (Discord, Skype, or Team\+Speak to name a few).

The \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceBabel}{Babel}} consists of a client and a server, clients connect to the server to find other clients and start a call. Calls are made between clients following a Peer-\/to-\/\+Peer architecture.\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md2}
\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md3}
\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{Build from sources}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md4}
Sources are hosted on Git\+Hub You can clone the repository with the following command

\begin{DoxyVerb}git clone https://github.com/Octopus773/Babel.git
\end{DoxyVerb}


The project is using \href{https://conan.io/}{\texttt{ conan}} to handle it\textquotesingle{}s dependancies You may have to create a profile and add remotes to conan if it\textquotesingle{}s your first time with it

Projects conan needed remotes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item conancenter\+: \href{https://center.conan.io}{\texttt{ https\+://center.\+conan.\+io}}
\item bincrafters\+: \href{https://bincrafters.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/conan/public-conan}{\texttt{ https\+://bincrafters.\+jfrog.\+io/artifactory/api/conan/public-\/conan}}

mkdir build cd build conan install .. --build missing
\end{DoxyItemize}

It may takes time for conan to download sources and build them

We\textquotesingle{}re using \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ C\+Make}} to build the project in the build folder\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake ..
cmake --build .
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Binaries will be located in build/bin\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{How to use}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md5}
Here you go you got the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceBabel}{Babel}} but how to use it ???

First, you got 2 programs \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item babel\+\_\+client
\item babel\+\_\+server
\end{DoxyItemize}

To start the babel\+\_\+server you need to use a C\+LI and give the port as argument Here I\textquotesingle{}m starting the server on the port 4245 \begin{DoxyVerb}./bin/babel_server 4245
\end{DoxyVerb}


The client has a G\+UI, you can launch it like any other program

// T\+O\+DO set client images\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Connection to server}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md6}
In order to connect to a \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceBabel}{Babel}} server, you have to fill the address and port of the running server



If the connection is achieved you won\textquotesingle{}t get any message, just go to the login tab

When the client can\textquotesingle{}t connect to the server, you may see messages like this

\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Login}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md7}
Here you will be asked to give the username to represent you on the server, 

Our server doesn\textquotesingle{}t accept multiple connected users with the same username.\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Home Page}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md8}
Here you can see all the connected users with their usernames 

You can call a user by selecting its username and click on the call user button\hypertarget{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Call}\label{md_Documentation_UserDocumentation_autotoc_md9}
When a user want\textquotesingle{}s to call you, you will be asked if you want to join or not



During a call every user in the call will be displayed



You\textquotesingle{}re now able to use all the features of our \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceBabel}{Babel}}. Congrats !
